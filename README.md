  Enzo is a node-based procedural 3D modeling framework for Visual Effects and Animation.<br><br>

  It was created as an accessible alternative to existing industry tools, which are often prohibitively expensive, closed source, and resistant to user driven innovation.
  Enzo is currently designed as a proof of concept and hobby project. The goal is to build a lean functional foundation for further development, experimentation, and community contribution.
